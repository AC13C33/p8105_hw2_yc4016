# Problem 1

``` r
hw2p1_df = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

##### Description

These data are not “tidy”, becasue the route number is not a sigle
varible. So we need to convert `route` variables from wide to long
format. This will be useful when focusing on specific routes, but may
not be necessary when considering questions that focus on station-level
variables.

``` r
hw2p1_df %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    station_name             line    
    ##    <chr>                    <chr>   
    ##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
    ##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
    ## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
    ## # … with 455 more rows

The ode chunk selects station name and line, and then uses `distinct()`
to obtain all unique combinations. As a result, the number of rows in
this dataset is the number of unique stations.

``` r
hw2p1_df %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2
    ##    station_name                   line           
    ##    <chr>                          <chr>          
    ##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
    ##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
    ##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
    ##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
    ##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
    ##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
    ##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
    ##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
    ##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
    ## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
    ## # … with 74 more rows

Filter according to ADA compliance as an initial step. This produces a
dataframe in which the number of rows is the number of ADA compliant
stations.

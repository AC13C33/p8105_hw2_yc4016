# Problem 1

``` r
hw2p1_df = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

##### Description

These data are not “tidy”, becasue the route number is not a sigle
varible. So we need to convert `route` variables from wide to long
format. This will be useful when focusing on specific routes, but may
not be necessary when considering questions that focus on station-level
variables.
